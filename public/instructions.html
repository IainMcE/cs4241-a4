      <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
      <p>
        Liars Dice is a popular dice game that combines strategy and bluffing.
        The game is played with dice and can have multiple players. Here are the
        basic rules:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Each player starts with a set of dice (typically 5 dice per player).
        </li>
        <li>
          Players take turns making bids on the total number of dice showing a
          specific value (e.g., "Three 4s").
        </li>
        <li>Players can either raise the bid or challenge the previous bid.</li>
        <li>
          If challenged, all dice are revealed, and if the bid was accurate, the
          challenger loses a die. If the bid was inaccurate, the bidder loses a
          die.
        </li>
        <li>
          The game continues until only one player has dice remaining, and that
          player wins.
        </li>
      </ol>
